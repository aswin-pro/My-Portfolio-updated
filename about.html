        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Aswin, and I hail from the beautiful city
            of Dindigul. I am a passionate Full Stack Developer with a fresh perspective, having recently graduated
            with a bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Parvathy's Arts and Science College. My academic
            journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in web development, database management, and software
            engineering principles.

            Driven by a keen interest in creating robust and user-centric applications, I am currently exploring
            opportunities in Full Stack Development. My skills include proficiency in front-end technologies such as
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, complemented by expertise in back-end frameworks like Node.js,
            Express, and MongoDB. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
